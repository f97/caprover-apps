Since Gitea is running inside a container, you can optionally map a port (not 22) of the host to port 22 of the container, if you want to use git commands over SSH. You can perform port mapping in your CapRover dashboard, in App Config section. IMPORTANT: It will take up to 2 minutes for Gitea to be ready.
